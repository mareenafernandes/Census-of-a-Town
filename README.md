# Census-of-a-Town
Problem Statement: Records of a complete town needs to be stored &amp;amp; displayed. Besides this a special id number needs to be generated when a person enters his or her details. Using this id you can search the person or delete the details of the person from the list. You can also create a list of people whose monthly income is high and display a list of male and female and find the total no of people present in the town.   Functionalities supported by this project: 1. Creates a list of people in the town 2. Displays the list of all the people 3. Deletes the name of the individual person using his/her id no 4. Displays the list of male and female persons present 5. Finds details of a person with their id no 6. Gives a total count of people present in the town 7. Displays a list of people with a monthly income above a particular amount   Selected data structure: Doubly linked list since it saves space in the memory as compared to an array. Also by using a doubly linked list it is easier to find the details of a person &amp;amp; forward and backward traversal of data is possible which is not possible to achieve in a singly linked list or array. Deletion of a persons detail becomes easier using a doubly linked list.
